# Location-tracker
This is my Diploma final year project developed by me and my team. Developed in Android studio for mobile application and one Arduino program.
We Designed and Developed a tracking device that fetches the location of the device/laptop/vehicle even if it is not connected to the internet and sends it to a mobile application which shows the location on google maps.
